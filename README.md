# **Crowdfunding Smart Contract**

## **Overview**

The **Crowdfunding Smart Contract** is a decentralized application (DApp) deployed on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create and manage crowdfunding campaigns. Backers can contribute Ether to support projects they believe in, while campaign creators can raise funds for their initiatives. The contract is built with Solidity and includes various safeguards to ensure secure and reliable contributions and fund management.

## **Features**

- **Campaign Creation**: Users can create a new crowdfunding campaign with a funding goal and a deadline.
- **Contributions**: Backers can contribute Ether to support campaigns.
- **Goal Tracking**: The contract tracks the progress of each campaign towards its funding goal.
- **Withdrawals**: Campaign creators can withdraw funds if the funding goal is met by the deadline.
- **Refunds**: If the campaign does not meet its goal by the deadline, contributors can claim a refund.

## **Prerequisites**

To work with this project, you need to have the following installed on your local development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or later)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - Ethereum development environment
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - Browser extension for Ethereum

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crowdfunding-smart-contract.git
cd crowdfunding-smart-contract
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have `npm` installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies, including Hardhat.

### **3. Compile the Smart Contract**

To compile the Solidity smart contracts, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### **4. Deploy the Smart Contract**

You can deploy the contract locally using Hardhat's local blockchain or deploy it to a testnet like Ropsten or Sepolia.

#### **Local Deployment**

Start a local blockchain:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Deploy the contract:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

#### **Testnet Deployment**

Configure your `hardhat.config.js` with your testnet settings, then deploy to a testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

### **5. Interact with the Smart Contract**

You can interact with the deployed contract using a frontend interface, Hardhat console, or directly via web3.js/ethers.js scripts.

#### **Using Hardhat Console**

```bash
npx hardhat console --network localhost
```

Example commands:

```javascript
const Crowdfunding = await ethers.getContractFactory("Crowdfunding");
const crowdfunding = await Crowdfunding.deploy();

await crowdfunding.createCampaign("Save the Rainforest", 100, 30); // Create a new campaign
await crowdfunding.contribute(0, { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0") }); // Contribute 1 ETH to campaign 0
await crowdfunding.getCampaignDetails(0); // Get details of campaign 0
```

### **6. Running Tests**

You can run the tests included in the project to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## **Project Structure**

- **contracts/**: Contains the Solidity smart contract code.
- **scripts/**: Deployment scripts.
- **test/**: Unit tests for the smart contract.

## **Features to Explore**

- **Create Campaign**: Users can create campaigns by specifying a title, funding goal, and duration.
- **Contribute to Campaign**: Users can contribute to any active campaign by sending Ether.
- **Withdraw Funds**: If a campaign reaches its goal by the deadline, the creator can withdraw the funds.
- **Refund Contributors**: If a campaign fails to meet its goal by the deadline, contributors can claim a refund.

## **Security Considerations**

- **Input Validation**: The contract includes checks to ensure valid inputs for creating campaigns and making contributions.
- **Reentrancy Guards**: The contract uses security measures to prevent reentrancy attacks during withdrawals and refunds.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing full transparency.
